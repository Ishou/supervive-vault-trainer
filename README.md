# Supervive Vault Trainer

A fan-made, unofficial mini-game by Colin Auberger, based on the vault mechanic from **Theorycraft Games Inc.'s SUPERVIVE**.

## How to play

On PC, press `E` to initiate a round and `E` again to attempt stopping the cursor within the green range. Customize your experience with various options.

## Upcoming features

- Detailed information about vault mechanics on the website.
- Accuracy and error information displayed at the end of each round.
- More precise vault mechanics, including speed, size, and timer between rounds.
- Automatic difficulty adjustments (also mimicking teammates destroying red pylons).
- Tracking of vault health and time to crack the vault for scoring purposes.

## In-game vault mechanics (for reference)

- **Initiating the lock-picking:** Interact with the vault gate to trigger the lock-picking minigame.
- **Coutdown:** A green circle expands with a countdown timer before the yellow cursor begins to move.
- **Perfect Stop:** Stopping the cursor in the lighter green area results in a "perfect" stop, dealing 6125 damage to the vault gate. This increases the lock-picking difficulty and spawns a red pylon (maximum of 2).
- **Teammate Assistance:** Teammates can destroy red pylons to reduce difficulty and directly damage the vault gate for an additional 6125 damage.
- **Good Stop:** Stopping the cursor in the darker green area deals 3063 damage to the vault gate and increases difficulty.
- **Failed Stop:** A failed stop decreases difficulty, but spawns blue orbs that float toward you. Teammates must destroy these orbs before they reach you to avoid taking damage and being forced out of the lock-picking minigame.
- **Exiting Early:** Exiting the lock-picking minigame prematurely has the same consequences as a failed stop.
